== Getting Started

=== Quickstart

The easiest to start using SmallRye Reactive Stream Operators is to start it directly in a _main_ class. You only need
to put `smallrye-reactive-streams-operators` in your `CLASSPATH` to use it.

Creates a Maven project, and include the following dependency in your pom.xml:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-streams-operators</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Once created, create a class file with a `public static void main(String... args)` method:

[source,java]
----
include::../examples/quickstart/src/main/java/io/smallrye/reactive/operators/quickstart/QuickStart.java[]
----

Once everything is set up, you should be able to run the application using:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.smallrye.reactive.operators.quickstart.QuickStart
```

Running the previous example should give the following output:

```
>> HELLO
>> SMALLRYE
>> REACTIVE
>> STREAM
>> OPERATORS
```

The Reactive Streams Operator is intended to be used in other software and not as a standalone _api_. However, to give you a
better overview the 2 following quickstart explains how to use it in Eclipse Vert.x applications and  Apache Camel
applications.

=== Using Reactive Streams Operators in a Vert.x application

http://vertx.io[Eclipse Vert.x] is a toolkit to create reactive and distributed systems. In addition to the _bare_ Vert.x
API, you can also use Vert.x using RX Java 2. As a consequence, you can wrap Vert.x _streams_ and use Reactive Stream
Operators to manipulate them:

include::../examples/quickstart-vertx/src/main/java/io/smallrye/reactive/operators/quickstart/DataProcessor.java[]
----

This example creates an HTTP server and for each request to collect 5 messages sent by another component on the Vert.x event
bus. It computes the sum of these 5 elements and writes the result to the HTTP response. It's important to notice that
the messages coming from the event bus are sent asynchronously. So, it would not be possible to write the previous code
using _java.util.streams_.

When used in a Vert.x application, Reactive Stream Operators can be used to processed data and compute an asynchronous result.

=== Using Reactive Streams Operators in a Camel application

https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel] is a toolkit to define routing and mediation rules, mainly used to integrate
systems, using enterprise integration patterns. Apache Camel provides more than 200+ components so that it can
integrate virtually with anything.

You can combine Reactive Stream Operators and Apache Camel thanks to the
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-reactive-streams/src/main/docs/reactive-streams-component.adoc[Camel Reactive Stream Component].

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::../examples/quickstart-camel/src/main/java/io/smallrye/reactive/operators/quickstart/QuickStart.java[]
----

You can also use Camel to create Reactive Streams `Publisher` and transform the items using Reactive Streams Operators.
